{"name":"Epilepsy","code":"G40","facts":{"0":"Up to the point of about 24g of alcohol per day the curve between alcohol and the risk of epilepsy was relatively flat, after which, however, the risk curve increased steeply with increasing levels of consumption.","1":"A number of deaths are “sudden unexpected death in epilepsy” (SUDEP) where no cause of death is found at necropsy. Some of those are related to alcohol or are cases where the deceased previously have been admitted to hospital because of alcohol abuse, ranging from very few cases to 38% in different studies.","2":"If you drink in moderation you’re not likely to experience seizures, and you’re also probably not going to have withdrawal symptoms if you stop drinking, so you wouldn’t have to worry about experiencing withdrawal-related seizures."}}
